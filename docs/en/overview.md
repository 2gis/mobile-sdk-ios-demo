# iOS SDK

iOS SDK is an SDK that allows you to add a 2GIS map to your iOS application. It can be used to display the map in your layout, add custom markers to it, and highlight various objects on the map, such as buildings, roads, and others.

## Getting an access key

Usage of this SDK requires an API key to connect to 2GIS servers and retrieve the geographical data. This API key is unique to the SDK and cannot be used with other 2GIS SDKs.

To obtain the key, [contact us](https://dev.2gis.ru/order/).

## Installation

In order to use the iOS SDK, add a dependency to the [Swift Package](https://github.com/2gis/native-sdk-ios-swift-package) to your project.
Read [this article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) to learn how one can add a package dependency.

### Minimum requirements:

- XCode 12;
- To run the demo project through Xcode, you need to use any simulator or iOS device (iPadOS) 13.0+. This is due to the use of the [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) in the project.
